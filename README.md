 "Tried to listen to a value exposed with provider, from outside of the widget tree.\n\nThis is
 likely caused by an event handler (like a button's onPressed) that called\nProvider.of without
 passing `listen: false`.\n\nTo fix, write:\nProvider.of<CartModel>(context, listen: false);\n\nIt is
 unsupported because may pointlessly rebuild the widget associated to the\nevent handler, when the
 widget tree doesn't care about the value.\n\nThe context used was: SliverList(delegate:
 SliverChildBuilderDelegate#1ec3b(estimated child count: 1), renderObject: RenderSliverList#3e101
